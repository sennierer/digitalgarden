# DH notes
Blog-like notes on my work in [ACDH-CH](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh)

## Presentations
None-exhaustive list of presentations given at various occasions
- We are currently working on a new edition system for the [Austrian Biographical Dictionary](https://www.biographien.ac.at/oebl?frames=yes). The system is based on open-source components, completely web-based and allows to keep the whole edition process in one framework. [The presentaion](https://sennierer.github.io/irs_ndb_3-22/) was given at a workshop of the NDB (Neue Deutsche Biographie) in March 2022.
- One of the H2020 projects we are currently engaged in is [[website/InTaVia|website/InTaVia]]. InTaVias ultimate goal is to integrate national biographies from Austria, Slovenia, The Netherlands and Finland, semantically enrich the data, link it to Cultural Heritage data[^1]. [This presentation](https://sennierer.github.io/intavia-review-meeting-2022/) was done for the first year review meeting. It highlights decisions and implementations and status of WP3 - Data Integration and Curation.
